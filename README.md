This project lets you type in some text and then shows the top 5 most common words with how many times they appear. It helped me get better at building web pages using JavaScriptâ€”like making buttons and text areas on the fly instead of writing them directly in HTML. I also practiced working with strings and sorting data in a way that handles ties nicely.
