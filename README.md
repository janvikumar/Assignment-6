# Assignment-6

This project lets you type in some text and then shows the top 5 most common words with how many times they appear. It helped me get better at building web pages using JavaScript—like making buttons and text areas on the fly instead of writing them directly in HTML. I also practiced working with strings and sorting data in a way that handles ties nicely.
